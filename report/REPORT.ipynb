    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This report serves as my final project for the CQF program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to develop a model that predicts **daily upward movements** in the stock price of [**Adobe**](https://www.adobe.com/) (ticker: ADBE), using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The choice of Adobe pays tribute to my early career as a graphic designer, during which Adobe tools accompanied me through one of the most creative periods of my life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable is a binomial classification labeled as $[0, 1]$, where $1$ indicates a positive price movement. The model will be trained, evaluated, and tested on a five-year dataset spanning **from January 1, 2020 to July 1, 2025**.\n",
    "\n",
    "_The report highlights the project workflow, covering decision flows, mathematical rationale, and analytical insights. For the full executable code, please refer to `DL Tuo Li CODE/DL Tuo Li CODE.ipynb`._\n"

    "Then, I will leverage the function of `add_all_ta_features` from `ta` library to automatically generate a wide range of technical indicators from the OHLCV (open, high, low, close, volume) data. This step efficiently enriches the dataset with 80+ indicators across the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Volume**: OBV, CMF, MFI, NVI, ATR, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Volatility**: Bollinger Bands, Keltner Channels, Donchian Channels, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trend**: SMA, EMA, MACD, ADX, Ichimoku, Parabolic SAR, Aroon, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Momentum**: RSI, Stochastic RSI, ROC, PPO, TSI, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Others**: daily returns, log returns, cumulative returns, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "After generation, further feature refinement steps are applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Remove redundant return feature**  \n",
    "Since the daily return is already present in the dataset, the duplicated `others_dr` feature generated by `add_all_ta_features` is dropped to avoid redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Consolidate sparse PSAR trend signals**  \n",
    "Among the trend indicators generated by `add_all_ta_features`, `trend_psar_up` and `trend_psar_down` exhibit a high number of missing values due to the mechanics of the Parabolic SAR (PSAR), which trails price movements using a dynamic stop level. The PSAR is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "PSAR_t = PSAR_{tâˆ’1} + AF \\cdot (EP_{tâˆ’1} âˆ’ PSAR_{tâˆ’1})\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "- $AF$ is the acceleration factor, starting at $0.02$ and capped at $0.2$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $EP$ is the extreme point (highest high during an uptrend or lowest low during a downtrend) \n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of the features:\n",
    "- `trend_psar_up`: Contains PSAR values during uptrends (dots below price), otherwise NaN\n",
    "\n",
    "- `trend_psar_down`: Contains PSAR values during downtrends (dots above price), otherwise NaN\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify, I create a new feature column `psar_trend` with directional encoding to interpret the information from these 2 features::\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1` for uptrend\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-1` for downtrend\n",
    "\n",
    "- `0` for neutral\n",
    "\n",
    "After generating `psar_trend`, the original two PSAR columns are removed to reduce sparsity and simplify the feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Transform drift/non-stationary price-reflective features**  \n",
    "Several generated features directly reflect price movement, inheriting drift and non-stationarity:\n",
    "- `trend_sma_fast`, `trend_sma_slow`, `trend_ema_fast`, `trend_ema_slow`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `trend_ichimoku_conv`, `trend_ichimoku_base`, `trend_ichimoku_a`, `trend_ichimoku_b`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `trend_visual_ichimoku_a`, `trend_visual_ichimoku_b` \n",
    "\n",
    "Using standard or minmax scalers on them would cause data leakage, as future non-stationary values affect scaling. To address this, these features are converted into relative ratios by being divided with the dayâ€™s closing price. For example:  \n",
    "$$\\text{trend\\_sma\\_fast\\_div\\_close} = \\frac{\\text{trend\\_sma\\_fast}}{\\text{close}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation reduces drift, normalizes scale, and preserves interpretability without leakage. The original columns of them are then removed and replaced by the newly created ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Add more features for daily variance**  \n",
    "Finally, I manually include two basic range-based features to capture intraday price movement:\n",

    "$$\\text{o-c} = \\text{open} - \\text{close}$$"
